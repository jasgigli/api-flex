Here are some suggested features you might consider adding to your **Api-Flex** library to enhance its functionality and usability:

### Suggested Features

1. **Rate Limiting Handling**:
   - Implement a feature that automatically handles rate limiting responses from APIs, potentially by queuing requests or adjusting the retry logic based on the limits specified in the response headers.

2. **Custom Error Handling**:
   - Introduce a mechanism for custom error classes that can differentiate between types of errors (e.g., network errors, HTTP errors, API-specific errors) for better error management.

3. **Dynamic Request Interceptors**:
   - Allow users to dynamically add or remove interceptors at runtime, giving more flexibility for different contexts (e.g., changing headers based on user authentication status).

4. **Batch Requests**:
   - Provide functionality for sending multiple API requests in a single batch, which can improve performance and reduce network overhead.

5. **Abortable Requests**:
   - Implement support for aborting ongoing requests, allowing users to cancel API calls if they are no longer needed (useful for frontend applications).

6. **Response Schema Validation**:
   - Add support for response schema validation using libraries like Joi or Yup to ensure that the response data matches expected structures.

7. **Enhanced Caching Strategy**:
   - Introduce advanced caching features, such as cache expiration policies or the ability to cache based on different keys (e.g., URL + request parameters).

8. **Custom Fetch Functionality**:
   - Allow users to provide their own fetch implementation (for instance, if they want to use Axios instead of the built-in fetch) while still keeping your libraryâ€™s features intact.

9. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrate logging capabilities that can log requests and responses for debugging purposes, or provide hooks for integrating with monitoring services.

10. **Throttling Mechanism**:
    - Implement a throttling mechanism that allows users to control how frequently requests are sent to a particular API, preventing overwhelming the server.

11. **Configurable Timeouts Per Request**:
    - Allow users to set different timeout values for each request, rather than a single global setting.

12. **Pagination Handling**:
    - Provide built-in utilities to manage pagination when dealing with APIs that return large datasets.

13. **Offline Support**:
    - Consider adding functionality to handle offline scenarios, like queuing requests for later when the network is available.

14. **Multi-language Support**:
    - If applicable, consider internationalization features that allow your library to be easily translated into different languages.

15. **Progress Indicators**:
    - If working with file uploads or downloads, adding progress indicators would enhance the user experience by providing feedback on long-running operations.

### Conclusion
Adding any combination of these features could make **Api-Flex** even more robust and user-friendly, catering to a wider range of use cases. Always consider user feedback and the evolving needs of developers when planning new features to ensure your library remains relevant and valuable.
